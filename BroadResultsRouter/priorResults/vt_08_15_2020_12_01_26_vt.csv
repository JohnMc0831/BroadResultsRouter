12034849,15311673,Isadora Snapp,VT,,8/14/2020,,08/15/2020 11:18:30,NEG,2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) not detected by the qRT-PCR assay. Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1225700830

12034522,13021456,Reilly Howard,VT,,8/14/2020,,08/15/2020 11:18:39,INCONCLUSIVE,Inconclusive for 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR with one of the two viral probes (either N1 or N2) being positive while the other is not detected after two attempts on this specimen. Consider re-collection of specimen. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1202323403
