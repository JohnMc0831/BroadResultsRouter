12257801,0020425346,Robert Clough,VT,,9/6/2020,,09/07/2020 15:36:19,NEG,2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) not detected by the qRT-PCR assay. Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1225759486
12261297,0020425483,Jilmar Lopezramos,VT,,9/6/2020,,09/07/2020 15:36:27,INCONCLUSIVE,Inconclusive for 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR with either (a) one of the two viral probes (either N1 or N2) being positive while the other is not detected after two attempts on this specimen or (b) results are discordant after two attempts on this specimen. Consider re-collection of specimen. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1225759492
12258933,0005927942,Oliver Plunkett,VT,,9/6/2020,,09/07/2020 15:36:27,INVALID,This specimen failed to produce a valid result after two attempts. An invalid result means no nucleic acids (viral or human) were detected by qRT-PCR. Consider re-collection of specimen.,1225759466
