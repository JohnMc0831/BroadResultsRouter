12157275,0006026843,Conrad Aube,VT,,8/26/2020,,08/28/2020 01:54:42,NEG,2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) not detected by the qRT-PCR assay. Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1229100489
12157862,0011129913,Jeffrey Williams,VT,,8/26/2020,,08/28/2020 01:54:41,INVALID,This specimen failed to produce a valid result after two attempts. An invalid result means no nucleic acids (viral or human) were detected by qRT-PCR. Consider re-collection of specimen.,1229100537
