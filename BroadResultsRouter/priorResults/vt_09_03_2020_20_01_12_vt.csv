12227333,0020424283,Logan Winchester,VT,,9/3/2020,,09/03/2020 18:18:19,POS,Positive for detection of 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR.,1202339064
12225102,0018223669,John Curtis,VT,,9/2/2020,,09/03/2020 18:18:33,INCONCLUSIVE,Inconclusive for 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR with either (a) one of the two viral probes (either N1 or N2) being positive while the other is not detected after two attempts on this specimen or (b) results are discordant after two attempts on this specimen. Consider re-collection of specimen. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1202319101
12228996,0001405232,Kaitlin Garrison,VT,,9/2/2020,,09/03/2020 18:18:39,NEG,2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) not detected by the qRT-PCR assay. Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1202339005
