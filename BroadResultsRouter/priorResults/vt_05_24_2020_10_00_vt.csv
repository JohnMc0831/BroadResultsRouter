11302527,18897454,Espoir Muzaliwa,VT,,5/22/2020,,05/24/2020 08:20:19,INCONCLUSIVE,Inconclusive for 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR with one of the two viral probes (either N1 or N2) being positive while the other is not detected after two attempts on this specimen. Consider re-collection of specimen. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1202200082
11299216,20385617,Stephen T Shine,VT,,5/22/2020,,05/24/2020 08:20:20,INVALID,This specimen failed to produce a valid result after two attempts. An invalid result means no nucleic acids (viral or human) were detected by qRT-PCR. Consider re-collection of specimen.,1202182077
11302224,20385784,Trenten M Reed,VT,,5/22/2020,,05/24/2020 08:20:21,NEG,2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) not detected by the qRT-PCR assay. Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1202200026
