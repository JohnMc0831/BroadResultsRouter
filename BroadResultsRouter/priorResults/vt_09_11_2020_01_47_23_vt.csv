12294106,0020426661,Rebecca Raub,VT,,9/10/2020,,09/11/2020 01:18:23,INCONCLUSIVE,Inconclusive for 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR with either (a) one of the two viral probes (either N1 or N2) being positive while the other is not detected after two attempts on this specimen or (b) results are discordant after two attempts on this specimen. Consider re-collection of specimen. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1225759684
