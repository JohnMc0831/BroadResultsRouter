Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1202279488

Consider re-collection of specimen. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined.
