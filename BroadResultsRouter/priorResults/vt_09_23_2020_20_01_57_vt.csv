12415095,0014908206,Curtis Green,VT,,9/22/2020,,09/23/2020 18:18:34,POS,Positive for detection of 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by qRT-PCR.,1229117642
12415387,0020430553,Jakob Loringer,VT,,9/22/2020,,09/23/2020 18:18:37,INVALID,This specimen failed to produce a valid result after two attempts. An invalid result means no nucleic acids (viral or human) were detected by qRT-PCR. Consider re-collection of specimen.,1229117616
12415913,0016355034,Tabitha Best,VT,,9/22/2020,,09/23/2020 19:09:36,NEG,2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) not detected by the qRT-PCR assay. Consider testing for other respiratory viruses or re-collecting for 2019-nCoV testing. Note: Optimum timing for peak viral levels during infections caused by 2019-nCoV have not been determined. Collection of multiple specimens from the same patient may be necessary to detect the virus.,1227353706
